# Software Engineering Interview

Software engineering interview specific to WordPress

# Instructions

I am the team lead of an eCommerce store that runs WooCommerce. When our customers make orders, drivers on my team bundle several orders into what we call *dispatches* and then go make the deliveries to the various customers. Customer support has a hard time determining which orders were delivered by which driver in which dispatch. 
Create a plugin that will allow my customer support team to assign one or more orders to a dispatch from the WordPress admin dashboard. 

A dispatch is a collection of orders to be delivered by a particular driver at a particular time.

It should enable customer support to create a dispatch by providing the driver's first name, last name, phone number and the car license plate.

The plugin will be mantained by my team of developers so please document the solution.
